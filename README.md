# Chainslist Block Explorer

> A Submission for Week 3 ETH SD / Alchemy Bootcamp

I accomplished this block explorer by a lot of copying and pasting...
My goal was to create a stunning block explorer with the highest quality visual
design. I looked no further for inspiration than from Craigslist. To accomplish
the same state-of-the and battle-tested art design UX from Craigslist, and with
the very limited time I had to accomplish my goal, I had no option but to copy
and paste the CSS stylesheets from craigslist.org (all rights reserved).
Only once I had the fully stylesheet, could I then layout the structure of my
application.

This project tackles three primary goals:

1. View latest blocks from the home screen.
2. View a specific block details from the blocks screen
3. View transaction details from the transactions screen
